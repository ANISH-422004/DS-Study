    "# What is OOP (Object Oriented Programming)? \n",
    "It is a programming paradigm that uses \"objects\" to design software. An object is an instance of a class, which is a blueprint for creating objects. OOP focuses on the concept of objects that contain data and methods to manipulate that data and other conpcepts like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation etc are also part of OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## what problems does OOP solve?\n",
    "1. generality to sepecificity : ex : linux os has many distributions like ubuntu, kali, fedora etc. All these distributions have some common features but also have some specific features. OOP allows us to create a general class (linux os) and then create specific classes (ubuntu, kali, fedora) that inherit from the general class.\n",
    "2. code reusability : OOP allows us to create classes that can be reused in different parts of the code. This reduces code duplication and makes the code more maintainable. ex: we can create a class for a database connection and then use that class in different parts of the code instead of writing the same code again and again.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### OOPS gives a programmer the power to create his own data types. These data types are known as classes and the objects created from these classes are known as instances. Classes can have attributes (data) and methods (functions) that operate on the data. This allows for better organization of code and makes it easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Principles of OOP\n",
    "1. class : A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that an object of that class will have.\n",
    "2. object : An object is an instance of a class. It contains data and methods that operate on that data.\n",
    "3. inheritance : Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. This allows for code reusability and helps to create a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "4. polymorphism : Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. It allows for methods to be used in different ways depending on the object that is calling them.\n",
    "5. encapsulation : Encapsulation is the mechanism of hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only the necessary parts. This helps to protect the data and ensures that it is accessed in a controlled manner.\n",
    "6. abstraction : Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts. It allows for the creation of abstract classes and interfaces that define the behavior of objects without specifying the implementation details."

Magic methods allow you to customize how your objects behave when they are used with built-in functions and operators.\n",

    "examples of magic methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__init__`: This method is called when an object is created and is used to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
    "  Benefit ? : when we dont wanna give the control to user and want automatic initialization of attributes. -- set up some values when a program starts ex : createing DB connection, **setting up config values** and setting etc.\n",

    "##### if Earth is class , humans are objects , then god will but whcih attribute in \\__init_ ? its death time , birth time etc. so that humans dont have to set it manually.\n",

    "- `__str__`: This method is called when the `str()` function is used on an object and is used to define the string representation of the object and it is called when the `print()` function is used on the object ex : print(object123).\n",
    "- `__add__`: This method is called when the `+` operator is used on two objects and is used to define how the objects should be added together. Triggers when we do obj1 + obj2\n",
    "- ` __sub__`: This method is called when the `-` operator is used on two objects and is used to define how the objects should be subtracted. Triggers when we do obj1 - obj2\n",
    "- `__mul__`: This method is called when the `*` operator is used on two objects and is used to define how the objects should be multiplied. Triggers when we do obj1 * obj2\n",
